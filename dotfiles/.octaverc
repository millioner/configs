setenv("GNUTERM", "X11")
graphics_toolkit("gnuplot")

# Oh, just some notes how I've made it working:
# here is a link helped me - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34926856/octave-freeze-when-it-needs-to-plot
# and here is a commands I used
# > brew reinstall octave --with-gui   # maybe it's not necessary, not sure again
# > brew reinstall gnuplot --with-x11  # this one definitely did the job
